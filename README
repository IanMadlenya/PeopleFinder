Cruncher -- PeopleTracker

File Structure:

Path: /data
Notes: Ignored in the .gitignore. Holds information from fetching JSON files from Crunchbase.com/Api

Path: /resources
Notes: Just some documents to save related to analysis and other things on top of the core code base

Files:

common.rb - some shared monkey patches and constants used by other files
downloader.rb - parallel fetching of crunchbase people and companies in json format, stores to /data
cruncher.rb - loads crunchbase data into mongodb. will read from /data, data will not be overwritten into MongoDB.

Future notes:
It'd be good to timestamp the data directories so we can do pulls daily and then run the cruncher on the new directories, by date.
